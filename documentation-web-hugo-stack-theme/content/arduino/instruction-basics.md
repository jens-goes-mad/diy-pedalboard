## Processor basics

We won’t dive into the mysteries of electronics — no transistors, resistors, gates, or logic circuits today.
We’ll treat all that as given and jump straight into the fun part: how a processor works.

The ATmega328P is an 8-bit microcontroller from Microchip (originally Atmel), part of the AVR family.
It uses a modified Harvard architecture, which means it has separate memories and buses for program and data.
This allows for simultaneous access and enables faster, more efficient processing.

Key features:
* 8-bit RISC architecture (Reduced Instruction Set Computer).
* 32 general-purpose working registers.
* Around 130 Opcodes (Instructions)
* Single-level pipeline (single core).
* Operating clock frequency is typically 16 MHz.

## Introduction to Timing Concepts

Understanding how a microcontroller operates starts with four fundamental concepts: clock, clock speed, instructions, 
and instruction cycles. These ideas form the foundation for how all digital processors — including microcontrollers 
like the ATmega328P — actually execute code and turn instructions into real-world actions.

### The Clock

At the core of every microcontroller is a clock — a tiny circuit that generates a regular stream of electrical pulses. 
This signal acts as a timing reference for everything the processor does. Each pulse is called a clock cycle, 
and every internal operation is synchronized to these pulses.

Just like a drummer setting the pace for a band, the clock ensures that all parts of the CPU work in harmony, 
one step at a time. Sidekick: how do you know, that a drummer knocks at rehearsal door? Knocking speeds up! 

Clock speed measures how many clock cycles occur every second. It’s expressed in Hertz (Hz):
> 1 Hz = 1 cycle per second<br>
> 1 MHz = 1 million cycles per second<br>
> 16 MHz = 16 million cycles per second<br>

For example, the ATmega328P microcontroller typically runs at 16 MHz.
This means its internal clock ticks 16 million times per second.
Each tick provides an opportunity for the CPU to do something — like fetching, decoding, or executing an instruction.

### Instructions

A CPU instruction is a basic command that tells the processor exactly what to do.
These instructions are part of the machine code generated by your program (often written in C, compiled, and then
translated into low-level operations).

Real-world analogy:
A processor is clearly male — it executes exactly what it’s told to do (just like a man following his wife’s instructions).
It processes commands in a strict, serial fashion: no parallel tasks, no context switching, no improvising.

Examples of CPU instructions:

    ldi r24, 0x01   — Load the value 1 into register 24
    add r24, r25    — Add the value in register 25 to register 24
    jmp label       — Jump to another part of the program

Each instruction performs a small, well-defined task.

### Instruction Cycles

Executing an instruction takes time — measured in instruction cycles.

On RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing) microcontrollers like the ATmega328P, most instructions are designed
to complete in just one clock cycle.
However, more complex operations — such as branches, jumps, or certain memory access instructions —
can take anywhere from 2 to 4 cycles to finish.

For example:
> At 16 MHz, 1 cycle = 62.5 nanoseconds<br>
> An instruction that takes 2 cycles would complete in 125 nanoseconds

This predictable timing is crucial for real-time and performance-critical applications.

### Why It Matters

Knowing how clocks, speeds, and instructions work helps you:
> Optimize loops for performance<br>
> Accurately measure execution time<br>
> Design reliable delays and timing-critical functions<br>
> Understand power consumption and efficiency

Whether you're blinking an LED or building a motor controller, understanding these core concepts gives you better 
control over your hardware.

Now it’s time to roll up our sleeves and really dig in.
In this next chapter, we’ll combine software and hardware experiments, learn how to calculate instruction cycles, 
and figure out how to predict the runtime of small programs in detail.

We’ll walk step by step through:
* Understanding instructions at the lowest level
* Measuring and estimating cycles
* Connecting these numbers to real-world timing on your microcontroller
