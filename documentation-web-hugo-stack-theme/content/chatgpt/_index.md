# ChatGPT...

...or how my friendly AI pair-programming dude helped me tackle programming questions and write documentation —
which, let’s be honest, is one of the most time-honored ways to procrastinate as a software developer.

Beyond that, I’ll show you a whole lot of examples of how ChatGPT helped me:
- Polish my English so I don’t immediately sound like a German tourist asking for the train station
- Solve tricky problems without flipping 27 StackOverflow tabs
- Generate actual code snippets and explain why they work

And yes — prove that ChatGPT understands humor (or at least does a convincing job pretending).

In the following sections, I’ll break things down into:
- The problem I was facing
- The prompt I gave
- The conversation we had
- And the final solution we achieved together

Let’s call it collaborative coding — with someone who doesn’t need coffee breaks.
