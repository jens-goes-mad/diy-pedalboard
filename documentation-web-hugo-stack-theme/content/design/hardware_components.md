From Bird’s Eye to Building Blocks, or: how to analyze the device from the outside in — looking at the front, 
the rear, the buttons, the I/O, and collecting real-world requirements not just from specs, but from how the user 
interacts with it. This perspective helps identify natural components and responsibilities — even before the 
first line of code is written.

## From Bird's Eye to Building Blocks

Zooming out gives us a high-level understanding of how the device naturally breaks into modular components
each with a distinct responsibility.

Here's a first breakdown of the core I/O subsystems and their roles:

### Front view

#### Foot Pedal Buttons
These act as output components that send press/release events to other modules.
Now here’s a question worth pausing on: How do we represent this data internally?
We could define our own protocol — something like “Button 1 pressed” over a custom API.
But there's also a smarter route: treat the entire foot controller buttons as a MIDI device itself.
If we can convince an Arduino (or similar microcontroller) to behave like a MIDI-compliant USB device,
integration becomes almost effortless. Always think in reusable, swappable components, regardless of software or hardware.

#### UI and MIDI Processing
This will be a major focus of its own. The UI and processing layer handles all real-time interactions, 
message transformation, routing logic, and visual feedback. Think of it as the conductor — orchestrating everything 
from button presses to SFZ playback.

### Rear view

#### MIDI (Hardware & Data)
Handles traditional DIN MIDI connectors, manages the serial interface, and transfers MIDI data between components.
It’s the backbone for communication with external MIDI gear.

#### USB Device Handling
USB isn't a core topic here, but it still plays a support role.
The system needs to detect device connections/disconnections, track connected peripherals,
and trigger a MIDI device list refresh whenever a new USB MIDI device shows up — even if no MIDI event has occurred yet.

#### Network Connectivity
Not essential for a pedal board — unless you’re developing.
Thanks to the API-driven architecture (details coming later), remote access becomes possible.
This means you can test and tweak the system from your desk, even if the pedal board is stationed on the other
side of the studio next to my keyboard rig.
