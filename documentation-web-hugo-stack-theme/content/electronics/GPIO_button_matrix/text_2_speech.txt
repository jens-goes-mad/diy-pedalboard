How does a Button matrix work?

Usually n Buttons require n wires to n inputs. To minimize the number of Pins,
buttons are organized in grid like structure.

The schematic LEDs on top are an indicator if a column is active (high) or not (low), later
read by a GPIO Pin as input, so a microcontroller can detect the state of a switch in a row.

The switches on the left simulate the microcontrollers GPIO Output pins and select a "row" to
allow checking button state for all buttons in ONE row at the same time.

Even buttons are pressed right now, no LED lights up.

The microcontroller has to actively pull down the ROW line to GND, so current can flow.
In an infinite loop we now check one row after the other.

In case more than one row is activated, the diodes prevents shortening the circuit, nevertheless
the result is an "OR" operation across each column, which is not we want...
