# Electronics

Now let’s get our hands dirty and step fully into the world of electronics and microcontrollers — all while continuing 
to think in components. We’ll explore how a microcontroller reads buttons, sends button states, controls lights, 
and manages MIDI in and out. 
Unfortunately, this section can’t be cleanly separated into neat silos, because electronics naturally blends 
different areas: 

Resistors and transistors come together to form circuits.

These circuits get combined inside ICs

And a collection of ICs can become something as powerful as an Apple IIe motherboard or as compact as a modern microcontroller.

All the circuits we build for our DIY pedal board — like the button matrix or MIDI I/O — are completely useless 
on their own. They only come alive when paired with software running on a microcontroller. 
This software, connected through GPIO pins, is what transforms passive electronics into an active, responsive, 
and ultimately musical device.

## And now?

In the next sections, we’ll explore:
- [Microcontroller: Arduino Nano and ESP32-S3](/electronics/mcu)

You can also jump to the closely related topics like:

- [Arduino](/arduino)
- [Arduino Processor basics](/arduino/instruction-basics)
- [AVR Cycles, Opcodes, Instructions](/arduino/instruction-loop-sample)

Or:

- [Design - Hardware/Electronics](/design/electronic_circuits)

Ports and Communication:

- [I²C: communicating with displays, sensors, and other low-speed peripherals](/electronics/i2c)

In the next **(upcomming)** sections, we’ll explore:
- [TBD: USB: how to detect, connect, and communicate with our main brain device](/electronics/usb)
- [TBD: MIDI I/O: sending, receiving, filtering, and transforming MIDI messages](/electronics/midi_io)
- [TBD: GPIO: connect our button matrix](/electronics/gpio_button_matrix)
- [TBD: RGB LED control: from subtle status indicators to full-on stage light effects](/electronics/rgb_led)

Each topic will come with practical examples, code insights, and real hardware use cases — because blinking LEDs are fun,
but controlling a rig like a pro is even better.
