ChatGPT...

...or how my friendly AI pair programming dude helped me to tackle programming questions and writing documentation,
which is one of the most preferred activities to waste time as a software developer. Furthermore I will show you a hell
lot of examples how it help polish my english to not immediately sound like a german, how smart it is in tackling
problems, creating software pieces, and we prove ChatGPT is aware about humor. In the following sections I will
describe the problem, the prompt, the chat and solution we achieved.

ChatGPT...
...or how my friendly AI pair-programming dude helped me tackle programming questions and write documentation —
which, let’s be honest, is one of the most time-honored ways to procrastinate as a software developer.

Beyond that, I’ll show you a whole lot of examples of how ChatGPT helped me:
- Polish my English so I don’t immediately sound like a German tourist asking for the train station
- Solve tricky problems without flipping 27 StackOverflow tabs
- Generate actual code snippets and explain why they work

And yes — prove that ChatGPT understands humor (or at least does a convincing job pretending)
In the following sections, I’ll break things down into:
- The problem I was facing
- The prompt I gave
- The conversation we had
- And the final solution we achieved together

Let’s call it collaborative coding — with someone who doesn’t need coffee breaks.
