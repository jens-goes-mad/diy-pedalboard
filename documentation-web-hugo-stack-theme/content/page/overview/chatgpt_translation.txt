This project started conceptually 5 years ago, and evolved over time solely in my head. Over the next couple of month
I'll show you how a modern AI - like chatgpt - will help you to speed up things even if you enter a new
programming language world and tool chain. And it started on May 2025 with finding a working BLOG software, otherwise
I could not share my thoughts. Whenever you enter a new field, a new software project I try to gather a birds view
first and afterwards look for building block, parts which serve a dedicated purpose and break it down over time.
The main rule is "separation of concern" and "single responsibility rule". Breaking down blocks into smaller components
forces me to use "selective ignorance" also knows as abstraction, thus it is allowed to ignore parts and work in these
later. But, as soon we start thinking in components, we have to think in interfaces, clear structure.

The Beginning (a.k.a. The Five-Year Think-Tank)
This project started — conceptually — about five years ago.
For a long time, it lived entirely in my head, evolving slowly, quietly, and occasionally waking me up at 3 a.m. with
brilliant ideas and equally terrible ones.

Now, in May 2025, it’s finally taking shape in the real world. And oddly enough, it all began by finding a blogging
platform that didn’t make me want to rage-quit. Without that, I couldn’t share any of this with you.

Over the next few months, I’ll show how modern AI — yes, tools like ChatGPT — can accelerate progress, even when
you’re diving into a completely new programming language or toolchain. You’ll see how I use it as a kind of rubber
duck with a PhD and infinite patience.
