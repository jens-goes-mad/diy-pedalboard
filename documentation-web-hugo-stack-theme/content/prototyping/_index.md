# Prototyping

> -- <cite>"The prefix prot-, or proto-, comes from Greek and has the basic meaning "first in time" or "first formed." 
> A prototype is someone or something that serves as a model or inspiration for those that come later. 
> The legendary Robin Hood, the "prototypical" kindhearted and honorable outlaw, has been the inspiration for countless 
> other romantic heroes. And for over a century, Vincent van Gogh has been the prototype of the brilliant, 
> tortured artist who is unappreciated in his own time."</cite><br>

The following sections provide an overview of different prototyping areas — both in software and hardware.

On the software side, I’ll walk you through simple, easy-to-understand examples (available on GitHub) that
illustrate core concepts. Each of these samples plays a fundamental role in its own dedicated section.

And while they may start out as isolated experiments, rest assured:
every one of them contributes to the final product in some way.
