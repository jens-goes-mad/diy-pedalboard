We finally launched the platform!

Surprisingly, not by working on the actual product, but by going down the wonderfully inefficient rabbit hole of
finding a blog system. We spent way too much time searching for something that was: Easy to use,
Themeable without hacking CSS for hours, Not allergic to Markdown and didn’t look like it was built in 2003

In the end, the most promising setup turned out to be a combination of Docker, HUGO (https://gohugo.io/
don't be scared, you can use HUGO without account), the HUGO Stack theme (https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack)
— and that’s what you’re reading right now. Naturally, when you get familiar with such a system you start to develop
your own templates. You can see progress (or not) on github
(https://github.com/jens-goes-mad/diy-pedalboard/tree/master/documentation-web-hugo-stack-theme)"

ChatGPT is such a powerful tool, so there is a section particular for [ChatGPT](/chatgpt) demonstrating usage and results.
But you can also spend time in useless comment sections and non-working iframes from cusdis (https://cusdis.com)
