From Foot switches to Full Stack â€” A Developerâ€™s Journey into Music Tech

After three decades of software development in finance, transportation, healthcare, and high-performance
trading / shopping systems, I decided to start something completely new â€” powered by curiosity, caffeine,
and my pair programming companion: ChatGPT.

The "DIY MIDI Pedal Board Music Workstation" â€” a modular, touchscreen-driven music controller with,
Real-time MIDI processing, SFZ sample playback, a custom Linux build system powered by Docker, C++, DART, FLUTTER,
Microcontrollers, hardcore refurbished hardware (save the planet!). From battling Java native image compilation
to repurposing LCD tiles like itâ€™s 1983, this spare-time project is packed with music tech, software architecture,
and creative problem-solving.

Join my pain. Learn from my mistakes (Short story â€” I donâ€™t make any)
Follow along as this thing slowly turns into something ridiculous â€” and hopefully ridiculously cool.
